# CopperBuild Prototype
C++ game engine for C++ using a C library raylib.

## Modules available:

Instance2 (2d shape classes)
StateManager (manage states of objects)
AssetManager (manage assets such as images, sound, fonts and etc.)
AnimationHandler (animate sprite assets)

## Notes:

AnimationHandler is a dependent module as it requires AssetManager.
Raylib project setup is recommended.

The project is written in the C++11 standard. Take caution with later versions if you use them (C++17 or newer).

## Modules to add:

InputHandler (handle keyboard, mouse and/or gamepad)
Instance3 (3d shape classes)
SceneKit (create a window and control display area)
AudioHandler (mix and use audio tracks)
LogicHandler (geometry for objects)

## License

MIT License allows users to use, modify and share assets. No credit is required, although it would be nice.
